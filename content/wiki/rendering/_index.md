There are many ways of rendering voxels, depending on the way they should look like, the underlying storage, performance and resource considerations, general method used, etc. etc. ... It all depends on what ***you*** ultimately want to *do*.

> **Note:**
> When we say that there are many ways of rendering voxels, we of course mean there is an *infinite amount* of ways.
> Seriously, we couldn't list them all, even if we tried! As such, this article will *never* be complete...

## Graphics Programming APIs

When writing a program that renders something to the screen,
you will usually want to make your code work across many platforms.
For that, there are two main API's you might use:
[OpenGL](/wiki/rendering/opengl) and [Vulkan](/wiki/rendering/vulkan).

- If you want to get started as fast as possible, with no regard as to how modern graphics cards work, use OpenGL.
- If you want your program to be future-proof and as high-performing as possible, use Vulkan.

## General Rendering Methods

### Meshing

Converting voxels into meshes, then using the rasterizer built into GPU's (or in software) to render a whole lot of triangles.

### Splatting

Converting voxels into screen-aligned quadliterals, rasterizing these, but then performing a Ray-AABB intersection test in the fragment shader to get cubes.

### Tracing

Send rays out of a camera into a volume of voxels, marching along them until voxels are hit, calculating a color based on the voxel-samples and hit-information.

This method makes it possible to achieve a high degree of photorealism and/or complex lighting effects, that are otherwise extremely hard to produce with rasterization.

## General Lighting Methods

**TODO**

- Global Illumination?
- Ambient occlusion?

## General Culling Methods

Depending on the method you choose to render voxels,
you may have to [cull your geometry](/wiki/rendering/culling),
so as to not overload your GPU with draw-calls and/or geometry.
