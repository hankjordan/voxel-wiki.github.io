Using an existing engine or writing a new one is, unfortunately, a hard question depending on many factors.

This article is split into two sections, one for using an existing game engine, the other for creating a new game engine from scratch, to help you decide what to do.

## Using an existing Game Engine

If you want to make a game, and get something playable & distributable within a... reasonable time-frame, using an existing game engine is *strongly recommended*.

The most commonly used game engines are as follows:

- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) (C#)
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) (C++, Blueprints)
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (C, C++, C#, VisualScript, GDScript)

> **TODO:**  Create one article for each engine.

## Creating a new Game Engine

> **Disclaimer:**  
> If you wish to *learn* how game engines works, creating one is a good way of approaching the issue.  
> After all, everyone has to learn to walk before they can run!

Following is a list of things you must keep in mind and be aware of *before* you begin:

1. You must have the concrete want (motivation) and will (discipline) to do so.
2. It is a massive amount of work, potentially spanning over years of your life.
3. Having several years of programming experience is a must; nobody will hold your hand in this endeavour.
4. All the tooling for asset-, level- and gameplay-creation? You'll have to write *all of that* too.
5. Running into driver bugs will eat a lot of time and make you want to rip your hair out.

The above list might make you question *"Why would anyone do this?!"*, to which most of [us](/wiki/community) will say... because it's fun! :D

A more concrete reason is that, by writing both the high- and low-level code, you can gain *a lot* of performance (that'd otherwise be left on the table) *and* the freedom to make some truly awesome things.
